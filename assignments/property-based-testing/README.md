# 📘 Assignment: Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to write property-based tests for Python code using the Hypothesis library. Practice designing properties, generating test data, and improving code reliability through automated test case generation.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Install and Set Up Hypothesis

#### Description
Install the Hypothesis library and set up your Python environment for property-based testing.

#### Requirements
Completed setup should:

- Install the Hypothesis library using pip
- Verify installation by importing Hypothesis in a Python script
- Create a basic test file (e.g., `test_sample.py`)


### 🛠️ Write Property-Based Tests

#### Description
Write property-based tests for a simple function (e.g., reversing a list, sorting, or string operations) using Hypothesis strategies.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define at least one function to test (e.g., `reverse_list`, `is_palindrome`, or similar)
- Write property-based tests using Hypothesis decorators and strategies
- Demonstrate that the tests can find edge cases or bugs (e.g., by intentionally introducing a bug and observing test failure)


### 🛠️ Reflect and Extend

#### Description
Reflect on the benefits of property-based testing and extend your tests to cover more properties or functions.

#### Requirements
Completed reflection and extension should:

- Write a short paragraph on what you learned about property-based testing
- Add at least one additional property-based test for a different function or property
- Ensure all tests pass after fixing any discovered bugs
